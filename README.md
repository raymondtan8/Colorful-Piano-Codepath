Submitted by: Raymond Tan

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I only used W3schools.com to reference the color codes for CSS colors, and Stackoverflow.com to look up some JavaScript syntax.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The biggest challenge that I faced with this project was keeping track of everything that was going on. For example, I got a little confused
on the difference between the guessCounter and the progress variable. I had to walk through my code again to see what function was calling/manipulating
what variables to further understand how everything fit together. Another roadblock that I ran into while completing this project was remembering all 
of the JavaScript syntax. I have a pretty decent background with JavaScript already, so I wanted to write out all of the code snippets myself rather 
than just copying + pasting from the tutorial. However, I noticed that I forgot a lot of the JavaScript syntax (but not the logic on how everything should work).
So I had to look through stackoverflow to refresh myself on the syntax. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I already a pretty decent background with web development, but this project was a pretty good refresher on basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript,
as I had forgotten a lot of the specific syntax. It was also pretty rewarding to finish, as I started with a blank program, and had a cool,
working game hours later. One general question that I have about web development involving this project is what could a user due to cause 
this program to crash? I was just thinking about the code that this program comprised of, and was wondering if it was even possible for the 
user to break this program (without actually manipulating the code, of course). 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would do a couple more things if I had more time to work on this project. First, I would create a back-end that allows users to create an account associated
with this website. This way, I can incorporate a leaderboard with users' accounts and make the game more competetive. Another thing that I would do is to add more 
buttons and sounds, so that the patterns can be harder to remember. Something else that seems cool to me is having some sort of multiplayer mode, where players can face off against each other. 
This ties back with the creation of user accounts.
